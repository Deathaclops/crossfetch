# CrossFetch
CrossFetch is a library for fetching local files on both native platforms and
WebAssembly. Files are read into a struct with the array of bytes. Text
can be read from the struct with the .text() method.

## Roadmap:
- [x] Fetch local files as bytes
- [x] Fetch local text files into strings  
- [ ] Add remote URL fetch support
